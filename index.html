    Assuming you install React with Bower, you include React,
    then the JSXTransformer which turns JSX into JavaScript 
    and then your React code.
    
    In production, you'll want to not use the JSXTransformer
    and should instead look at using something like Gulp, Grunt or
    WebPack to compile JSX into JavaScript. Also, check out:

    <p class="ui-droppable"><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a>'s nightmare first Clasico of this season got worse when <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/isco">Isco</a> was given a red card for a kick on Barcelona forward Neymar Jr. Already trailing by four goals, the last thing Los Blancos needed was to lose a man.</p>
<p><span>Trailing to strikes from&nbsp;</span><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/luis-suarez">Luis Suarez</a><span>, Neymar and Andres Iniesta, a frustrated Madrid side lost all discipline. Isco's gaffe summed up their dreadful day, capped by a 4-0 losing deficit.</span></p>
<p>The official Twitter account of Spanish publication <em>AS</em> confirmed Isco's dismissal, while offering its own critique of his rash actions:</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Isco kicks wildly at Neymar as he goes past him. Straight red. Utter daftness.</p>&mdash; AS English (@English_AS) <a href="https://twitter.com/English_AS/status/668141824830107648">November 21, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, members of a disillusioned home crowd actually appeared to endorse Isco's violent outburst, per ESPN's Dermot Corrigan:</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Red card now from Isco for having a hack at Neymar. Some fans at Bernabeu chant his name as he trudges off.</p>&mdash; Dermot Corrigan (@dermotmcorrigan) <a href="https://twitter.com/dermotmcorrigan/status/668141743485943808">November 21, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Catalan publication&nbsp;<em>Sport&nbsp;</em>bluntly condemned the nature of the tackle:</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Madrid down to 10 after Isco&#39;s nasty challenge on Neymar left the referee with little choice but to send him off.</p>&mdash; SPORT English (@Sport_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sport_EN/status/668142038391607297">November 21, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>Spanish football writer Sergi Dominguez was even stronger in his assessment of the incident:</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Isco sent off. He&#39;s the last player I expect him to do such thing. Disgusting.</p>&mdash; Sergi Dom√≠nguez (@FutbolSergi) <a href="https://twitter.com/FutbolSergi/status/668141738364547072">November 21, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>Isco's infraction was probably the lone moment of aggression Madrid showed all game. Being on the receiving end of such a humiliating scoreline to a bitter foe in front of home fans was always likely to provoke an unsavoury response from some members of Los Merengues.</p>
